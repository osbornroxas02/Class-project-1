### Notes

the project it self seem very doable but the thing that proved most difficult has dealing the github and terminal issues. I had alot of hurdles to jump over dealing with security issues from cloning the files. Spending even more time into developing a better undestanding ogt the terminal and how its works is something that requires more time and attention.
